# ATLS-5519
This repo has all my assignments for the University of Colorado, Boulder course ATLS-5519: (Im)practical Programming. All work is done in Python using Google Colab unless otherwise noted. Links are to github files for google colab notebooks. I took this in Summer Session A 2022 from 5/31 - 7/1/2022. 

**Week 1 - 5/31 - 6/2/2022**
* [Day 1](https://github.com/erinmr/ATLS-5519/blob/main/Day_1_ER_Submitted.ipynb) - random funny names, find palindromes and palingrams (future work, speed up the palingram checker. It takes an hour!) 
* [Day 2](https://github.com/erinmr/ATLS-5519/blob/main/Day2_Submitted_ER.ipynb) - Find anagrams and practice with permutations (future work - create anagram phrases that use all the letters) 
* [Day 3](https://github.com/erinmr/ATLS-5519/blob/main/Day_3_ER_Submitted.ipynb) - counting syllables to create lines of random poetry and testing the syllable counter with a different corpus (future work: bring in Markov 2 - a two word phrase predicts the 3rd word; Write full haiku 5-7-5; let user replace a line (1, 2 or 3)

**Week 2 - 6/7-6/9/2022 Focus was Ciphers**
* [Day 4](https://github.com/erinmr/ATLS-5519/blob/main/Day_4_ER_Submitted.ipynb) - Reverse and Caesar Cipher
* [Day 5](https://github.com/erinmr/ATLS-5519/blob/main/Day_5_ER_Submitted.ipynb) - Transposition and Substitution Cipher
* [Day 6](https://github.com/erinmr/ATLS-5519/blob/main/Day_6_ER_Submitted.ipynb) - Hack transposition and substitution, Affine and Vigenere Cipher

**Week 3 - 6/14-6/16/2022 Focus was different Olympiad Problems**
